# Goodreads Automation Web App

I read a lot and use Goodreads frequently to keep track of books I've read, books I want to read, and recommendations. However there are a couple things that frustrate me about Goodreads. I don't like how to add new books to the want to read shelf you can only add them individudally. Especially when getting a new list of book recommendations I would like to be able to just add the list of titles instead of adding each book manually. This tool allows the user to do that but automating the process of adding individual books. It can also retrieve the user's book recommendations from Goodreads and display the consolidated results in a table. There is also a feature that lets the user put in an address and displays a map of the nearest libraries using the Google Maps API.

I created the frontend with HTML and CSS and the backend with Django. I used selenium for web broswer automation. I have included videos demoing different parts of the application.
